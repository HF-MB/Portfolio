# Data Adjuster

**Data Adjuster** is a lightweight command-line tool that **adds and/or removes rows** from a dataset based on user-defined rules in a simple YAML configuration file.

It’s designed for data rebalancing, adjusting, and controlled manipulation. For example, to simulate new data distributions or stress-test models on modified datasets.

## How It Works

The Data Adjuster applies up to 3 “adjuster dimensions” (columns) defined in your `config.yml`. More dimensions can be added.

Each adjuster specifies:
- A **dimension name** to target (e.g., `itemCategory`)
- A set of **values** within that dimension (e.g., `Topwear`, `Accessories`)
- A **numeric factor** describing how that value’s data entries should be changed.

Under the hood, the tool computes an average **positive** and **negative** adjusters per data entry and then runs two processes:
1. **Copying Step** — adds data entry based on positive adjusters.  
2. **Removal Step** — flags data entry for deletion based on negative adjuster.

| Factor | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `0.2` | 20% chance for a copy. |
| `2.15` | Adds 2 guaranteed copies and a 15% chance for a third copy. |
| `-0.7` | 70% chance each data entry is removed. |
| `-1.0` or lower | Guarantees data entry removal. |

Each run is fully reproducible using a configurable random seed.

## How to Run

1. Place your .csv file inside the /input folder.
2. Make sure you filled out the config.yml
3. Open a terminal, navigate to where you saved the tools folder and run python main.py in your terminal.

## Example Dataset Dictionary

The example dataset `ecommerce_clothing_dataset.csv` found in this repository /input has been generated by AI. It is an example for what kind of data the adjuster can be used with.
